# J2S

J2S provides a framework to simplify the development of games

It provides a basic engine to run the game and a few AI strategies.

## How to start?

The easiest way to start is to have a look at the [Nim example](tree/master/examples/nim)

## Current limitations

The game engine does not support simultaneous actions.

The AI can only be used for game with complete information (no hidden resources or cards for example)
